            "\n",
            "*   **Sugar:** The foundation of most desserts. Comes in various forms like granulated, powdered (icing), brown, and caster sugar (superfine). Each has a different texture and molasses content, affecting the final product.\n",
            "*   **Honey:** A natural sweetener that adds a distinct flavor.\n",
            "*   **Maple Syrup:** Another natural sweetener, offering a unique flavor profile.\n",
            "*   **Corn Syrup:** Used for its texture-enhancing properties, often in candies and icings.\n",
            "*   **Molasses:** A byproduct of sugar production, providing a rich, dark flavor.\n",
            "*   **Other Syrups:** Agave, rice malt syrup, etc., used as alternative sweeteners.\n",

            "*   **Oil:** Provides moisture and a tender crumb. Often used in cakes and quick breads.\n",
            "*   **Shortening:** Offers a neutral flavor and creates a very tender texture, especially in pie crusts.\n",
            "*   **Cream:** Contributes richness and moisture. Used in whipped cream, ice cream, and sauces.\n",
            "*   **Coconut Oil:** Adds a distinct coconut flavor and moisture.\n",

            "*   **Spices:** Cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cloves, etc., add warmth and complexity.\n",
            "*   **Nuts:** Almonds, walnuts, pecans, etc., contribute flavor and texture.\n",
